# CMPUT 301 W25 - Lab 2: Android Basics

## Lab 2 Instructions

In Lab 2, we'll do: 

A quick review of [OOP principles](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/pluginfile.php/11705542/mod_label/intro/CMPUT301_LAB2_OOP_PRINCIPLES.pdf) and [Java Coding Conventions](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/pluginfile.php/11705542/mod_label/intro/Code_Conventions_Schoepp.pdf?)  

An introduction to Android Basics [Lab 2 Android Basics PDF](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/pluginfile.php/11705542/mod_label/intro/CMPUT301_LAB2_ANDROID_BASICS.pdf)

A demo to display list of items using ListView/ListAdapter [Lab 2 ListView Demo Example - Instructions PDF under Lab 2](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/pluginfile.php/11705542/mod_label/intro/CMPUT301_LAB_2_INSTRUCTIONS.pdf)

Lab Exercise - adding and removing items from ListAdapter (see the Lab 2 Participation Exercise below for more details.)


## Lab 2 Participation Exercise

Task: Modify/Expand ListyCity to allow for the addition of new cities as well as the deletion of existing ones in the ListView. The specifics of the design of this functionality are up to you.

> [!NOTE]
> If you could not attend the labs or do not have the code for ListyCity, follow the instructions in Lab 2 ListView Example - Instructions.

Hints:

1. You may want to use the OnClickListener methods discussed in the lab.

2. Ideally you should consider treating the cities as objects, however, in this exercise it may not be necessary.


Here are some screenshots from an example application that demonstrate the required functionality. 

> [!NOTE]
> Your app does not need to look exactly like this demo!

1. Press "ADD CITY" then type the name and press "CONFIRM". This adds a new city name to the listview  

2. Tap a city name to select it  then press "DELETE CITY" to remove the city from the listview.
